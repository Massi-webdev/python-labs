1.	Working on sample projects:
On this Python course we had the opportunity to work on multiple labs and projects. In this first section, I will talk about 5 labs we have worked on, I will show how it works with a provided code. Finally, I will use the logic of these 5 labs to answer question 2, which is the creation of a pong game on python.
a.	Functions: in Lab 1, we saw how to create a reusable block of code that performs a specific task when called (see example below).

b.	Lists: in module 10, we saw how to create a It is a collection of ordered items of any type, that can be changed after the listâ€™s creation (see example below).

c.	Conditional Statements: in module 4 and lab 4, we saw how to use conditional statements if, elif, else to allow a program to make logical decisions and execute different coded based on whether the condition is true or false (see example below).

d.	LOOPS - For loops: in module 4 and lab 4, we were able to create loops that were used to repeat a block of a code within a sequence or repeats an action a fixed number of times (see example below).

e.	User inputs and Data validation: Getting data from the user and making sure it is valid before using this data in the program (see example below).

f.	Try and Except: This is used for error handling 
Try block: we put code here that could cause an error
Except block: we put code here to handle the error if it happens 

Example: in final assignement py file, I have combined all these labs into one good example instead of showing old labs projects, I created a function that loops through a list of numbers provided by the user to find the biggest number and print it.
